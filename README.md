This is the fork of the [original rounded-window-corners extension][14] by
@yilozt, which is no longer maintained.

## Features

- Works with Gnome 45+
- Custom border radius and clip paddings for windows
- Blocklist for applications that draw their own window decorations
- Custom shadow for windows with rounded corners
- Option to skip libadwaita / libhandy application
- [Superelliptical][1] shape for rounded corners, thanks to [@YuraIz][2]
- A simple reset preferences dialog

## Compatibility

- [_Compiz alike magic lamp effect_][3]

    This extension automatically hides the shadow when the magic lamp effect is
    running. You need to restart (disable then enable) this extension after
    enabling _Compiz alike magic lamp effect_. 

## Notes

- The rounded corner effect for windows is based on this [shader][4] from
  mutter project
- TypeScript support for GJS is powered by [gi.ts][5]
