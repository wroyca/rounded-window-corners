## Installation

### From Gnome Extensions

The extension is available on [extensions.gnome.org](https://extensions.gnome.org). You can install it directly [from here](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/7048/rounded-window-corners-reborn/), or from the Extension Manager app.

### From pre-built archives

If you want to install the latest commit of the extension, you can get a
pre-built archive from GitHub Actions.

1. Sign in to GitHub.
2. Go to [the build action page](https://github.com/flexagoon/rounded-window-corners/actions/workflows/build.yml)
3. Click on the latest workflow run
4. Download the extension from the "artifacts" section at the bottom
5. Install it with the `gnome-extensions install` command

### From source code

1. Install the dependencies:
    - Node.js
    - npm
    - gettext
    - [just](https://just.systems)

    Those packages are available in the repositories of most linux distros, so
    you can simply install them with your package manager.

2. Build the extension

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/flexagoon/rounded-window-corners
    cd rounded-window-corners
    just install
    ```

After this, the extension will be installed to
`~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions`.

### From unofficial AUR packages on Arch Linux

If you use Arch, by the way, you can also install from the provided [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/) packages using [paru](https://github.com/Morganamilo/paru) or [yay](https://github.com/Jguer/yay). Two packages are available:

- [gnome-shell-extension-rounded-window-corners-reborn](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/gnome-shell-extension-rounded-window-corners-reborn) uses the pre-build archives
- [gnome-shell-extension-rounded-window-corners-reborn-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/gnome-shell-extension-rounded-window-corners-reborn-git) builds on your machine

Installation:

```zsh
paru gnome-shell-extension-rounded-window-corners-reborn
```

Note these packages are not official.
